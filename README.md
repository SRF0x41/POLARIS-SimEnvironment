# POLARIS-SimEnvironment

**POLARIS-SimEnvironment** is a test simulation environment for [**POLARIS**](https://github.com/SRF0x41/POLARIS), a CUDA-accelerated AI framework focused on flexible AI model creation with smaller datasets and real-time learning capabilities. This environment consists of a collection of Python programs designed to simulate various scenarios, providing a controlled setting to develop, test, and refine AI models. The goal is to enhance POLARIS's ability to adapt, process multimodal data, and learn selectivelyâ€”mimicking human cognitive processes. Future updates will expand its functionalities to support more complex simulations and interactions.
